### **5 and 7 Divisibility Finder - Editorial**

## Difficulty: Easy

## Prerequisites: Loops, Conditionals, List Operations, Basic Input/Output

### Problem Statement:
Participants are required to create a program that processes a list of numbers. The program should identify and generate a new list containing only the elements from the input that are divisible by both 5 and 7.

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Understanding the Task:**
   The problem is a simple exercise in list processing and arithmetic checks. Participants need to check each number's divisibility by 5 and 7, requiring a basic understanding of modular arithmetic (`%` operator in most programming languages).

2. **Solution Approach:**
   We start by reading the input list. For each element in the list, we check if it is divisible by both 5 and 7 (i.e., `number % 5 == 0` and `number % 7 == 0`). If both conditions are true, we add the number to the result list.

3. **Problem Constraints:**
   - Each element in the list is an integer such that 1 <= element <= 10000.
   
   These constraints indicate that the input numbers might be large but will stay within the integer range, avoiding overflow issues.

## Pseudo Code:

<pre><code>
read inputList
initialize resultList

for each number in inputList do
    if (number % 5 == 0) and (number % 7 == 0) then
        add number to resultList
    end if
end for

// Output resultList (implementation-dependent)
</code></pre>

### Time Complexity:
O(N), where 'N' is the number of elements in the input list. The algorithm checks each number exactly once.

### Space Complexity:
O(K), where 'K' is the number of elements divisible by both 5 and 7. This space is required for storing the results. The space consumption depends on the input and how many numbers satisfy the divisibility condition.

## Sample Code (Java):

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class DivisibilityFinder {
    public static List<Integer> findDivisibleNumbers(List<Integer> inputList) {
        // List to store the numbers that meet the condition
        List<Integer> resultList = new ArrayList<>();

        // Check each number in the input list
        for (Integer number : inputList) {
            // If the number is divisible by both 5 and 7
            if (number % 5 == 0 && number % 7 == 0) {
                resultList.add(number);
            }
        }

        return resultList;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage
        List<Integer> inputList = List.of(35, 10, 14, 70, 63, 100);  // A sample input list
        List<Integer> output = findDivisibleNumbers(inputList);
        System.out.println(output);  // Output will be [35, 70] since these are divisible by both 5 and 7
    }
}
