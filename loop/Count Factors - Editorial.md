### **Factor Count Analysis - Editorial**

## Difficulty: Easy

## Prerequisite: Loops, Basic Mathematics (Factors and Divisibility)

### Problem statement:
You're given a positive integer 'A.' Your task is to count all the factors of 'A.' A factor is any number that divides 'A' perfectly, meaning without any remainder. For example, the factors of 20 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 20.

### Short Explanation:
The solution requires iterating from 1 to the maximum possible factor, checking each number to confirm if it's a factor of 'A' by ensuring the remainder is zero. The efficient approach doesn't need to go beyond the square root of 'A.'

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Understanding Factors:** 
   Factors of 'A' are numbers that divide 'A' without leaving a remainder. The challenge is to identify all such numbers.
   
2. **Iterating through Potential Divisors:** 
   We can start from 1 and continue up to 'A', checking each number to see if it's a divisor. However, this isn't efficient.
   
3. **Optimization by Pairing Factors:** 
   Factors come in pairs. For every 'i' that divides 'A' perfectly, 'A/i' is also a factor. We leverage this property for an efficient solution, ensuring we don't iterate more than necessary by stopping at the square root of 'A'.
   
4. **Counting the Factors:** 
   By acknowledging the pairing nature of factors, we can simply double our count for each factor, except when 'A' is a perfect square.

5. **Problem Constraints:**  
   With the upper limit of 'A' being \(10^6\), our approach will run within a reasonable time frame for all possible inputs.

## Pseudo Code

<pre><code>
function countFactors(A) {
    Initialize count = 0
    for i = 1 to sqrt(A) do:
        if A % i == 0 then:
            if A / i == i 
                count += 1  // Perfect square case
            else 
                count += 2  // Factor pair
        end if
    end for
    return count
}
</code></pre>

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the algorithm is O(sqrt(A)), as the loop iterates only up to the square root of 'A', significantly reducing the number of iterations required.

### Space Complexity:
O(1), indicating that our algorithm's space requirements remain constant, regardless of the input size.

## Sample Code (Java):

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class FactorCountAnalysis {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        System.out.print("Enter the number A: ");
        int A = scanner.nextInt();
        int count = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i <= Math.sqrt(A); i++) {
            if (A % i == 0) {
                if (A / i == i) 
                    count += 1;  // Perfect square case
                else 
                    count += 2;  // Factor pair
            }
        }

        System.out.println("Number of factors: " + count);
    }
}
