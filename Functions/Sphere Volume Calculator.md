### **Sphere Volume Calculator - Editorial**

## Difficulty: Easy

## Prerequisites: Arithmetic, Math, Basic Programming

### Problem Statement:
Given the radius 'R' of a sphere, your task is to calculate the sphere's volume. The formula for the volume of a sphere is given by:

**Volume = (4/3) * π * R^3**

You need to return the ceiling of the volume, as the volume might not be an integer.

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Understanding the Task:**
   This problem is straightforward and requires knowledge of arithmetic operations and functions. You are given a radius 'R', and you need to calculate the volume of the sphere using the formula provided. Since the result might be a decimal, you need to return the smallest integer greater than or equal to the volume calculated (also known as the ceiling of the number).

2. **Solution Approach:**
   First, you calculate the volume using the formula for the volume of the sphere. Languages like Java and Python have built-in constants and functions for π (Pi) and the power operation. After obtaining the result, you then use the appropriate function to get the ceiling value of the volume.

3. **Problem Constraints:**
   The maximum value for 'R' is 500. This constraint ensures that the calculations will not result in values too large for standard data types (like 'int' or 'double') and built-in functions in most languages.

## Pseudo Code:

<pre><code>
read R
// Calculate the volume of the sphere using the formula
volume = (4.0 / 3) * π * R^3
// Get the ceiling value of the calculated volume
ceilingVolume = ceil(volume)
print ceilingVolume
</code></pre>

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity is O(1) because the calculation is a set of arithmetic operations that do not depend on the input size.

### Space Complexity:
O(1) since the solution does not require space that scales with input size — only a constant amount of space is used for the variables.

## Sample Code (Java):

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.lang.Math;

public class SphereVolumeCalculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int R = scanner.nextInt(); // Read the radius

        // Calculate the volume of the sphere
        double volume = (4.0 / 3) * Math.PI * Math.pow(R, 3);

        // Calculate the ceiling of the volume
        int ceilingVolume = (int) Math.ceil(volume);

        // Output the ceiling volume
        System.out.println(ceilingVolume);
    }
}
