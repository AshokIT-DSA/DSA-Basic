### **Calculating Circle Area - Editorial**

## Difficulty: Easy

## Prerequisites: Mathematics, Basic Programming

### Problem Statement:
You are given a positive integer 'R' representing the radius of a circle. The task is straightforward: compute the area of the circle and return the ceiling value of the result. This ensures that if the area is a real number, you return the smallest integer greater than or equal to the area.

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Understanding the Task:**
   The problem involves basic geometric calculation. Given the radius 'R' of a circle, you need to find its area. The formula involved is standard: Area = π * R². However, the result needs to be the ceiling value of the actual area calculation.

2. **Solution Approach:**
   We will use the Math library for two purposes:
   - To get the value of π, which is more precise than using an approximation like 3.14 or 22/7.
   - To get the ceiling value of the calculated area. The `Math.ceil()` method helps us round up the real number result.

   It's important to note that we are dealing with the precision of floating-point arithmetic here. While the value of π from the Math library is precise, it is still a floating-point approximation within the system's limits.

3. **Problem Constraints:**
   The radius 'R' of the circle is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000. This range is comfortably within the limits of integer data types and standard floating-point precision.

## Pseudo Code:

<pre><code>
read R
// Calculate the area using the formula: π * R²
area = π * R * R
// Get the ceiling of the calculated area
ceilingArea = ceiling(area)
print ceilingArea
</code></pre>

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity is O(1), meaning it requires a constant amount of time to perform the calculation regardless of the input size. This is because the operations involved (multiplication, accessing π, and ceiling) are all constant-time operations.

### Space Complexity:
O(1), as we are using a fixed number of variables and not utilizing any data structures that would increase based on input size.

## Sample Code (Java):

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class CircleArea {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int R = scanner.nextInt();

        // Calculating the area
        double area = Math.PI * R * R;

        // Getting the ceiling value
        int ceilingArea = (int) Math.ceil(area);

        // Printing the result
        System.out.println(ceilingArea);
    }
}
