### **Count Factors - Editorial**

## Difficulty: Easy

## Prerequisites: Loops, Basic Mathematics (Divisibility)

### Problem Statement:
You are given an integer 'A'. Your task is to determine and count all the distinct factors of this number. A factor is defined as any integer greater than 0 that can divide 'A' with no remainder left. For instance, for the number 20, its factors are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 20.

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Understanding the Task:**
   The problem requires us to find all numbers that divide the input number 'A' evenly, i.e., without leaving a remainder. This task is a fundamental application of divisibility rules and can be solved using a simple loop and basic arithmetic checks.

2. **Solution Approach:**
   To solve this problem, we'll use a loop to check each number from 1 to 'A' to see if it divides 'A' without leaving a remainder. We perform this check using the modulus operator (%), which returns the remainder of a division operation. If the remainder is 0, the current number is a factor.

3. **Problem Constraints:**
   Since 'A' can be as large as 300, our solution needs to handle numbers up to this upper limit. This constraint is very lenient and allows us to use a simple loop-based solution without worrying about optimizing for performance.

## Pseudo Code:

<pre><code>
read A
Initialize counter to 0
for i = 1 to A do:
    if A % i == 0 then:
        increment counter
    end if
end for
print counter
</code></pre>

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the solution is O(A) because, in the worst case, the loop runs 'A' times. Each iteration involves a constant-time modulus operation and a conditional check, which do not significantly impact the overall running time.

### Space Complexity:
O(1), as we are using only a constant amount of space. The space used for the 'counter' variable and a few other primitives remain the same regardless of the value of 'A'.

## Sample Code (Java):

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class CountFactors {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create scanner object to read input
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        // Read the integer 'A'
        System.out.println("Enter the number: ");
        int A = scanner.nextInt();
        
        // Initialize a counter for the factors
        int counter = 0;
        
        // Check every number from 1 to A to see if it's a factor
        for (int i = 1; i <= A; i++) {
            if (A % i == 0) {
                // It's a factor, so increment the counter
                counter++;
            }
        }
        
        // Print the number of factors
        System.out.println("Number of factors: " + counter);
    }
}
```

### Conclusion:
This problem serves as a good exercise for understanding loops and basic arithmetic operations in programming. While the problem itself is straightforward, related challenges could require finding prime factors, calculating the greatest common divisor, or working with more complex mathematical functions.
